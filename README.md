# NatasjaWezelpset1
First problemset for App Studio.

This application allows you to dress and undress mister Potato by checking and unchecking checkboxes that correspond to the bodyparts and/or accesories that you want to show. It also remembers which bodyparts/accesories it's showing when you change the state of your phone/tablet.

Examples:
Portret on my phone (a Lenovo C2)
Startscreen:
